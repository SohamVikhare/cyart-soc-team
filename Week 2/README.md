# SOC Internship – Week 2 
## Security Operations Center (SOC) Practical Implementation

This repository contains the Week 2 internship work focused on Security Operations Center (SOC) operations, including alert prioritization, incident classification, alert triage, evidence preservation, and full incident response lifecycle implementation.

The work demonstrates both theoretical understanding and practical simulation of real-world security monitoring and response activities using industry-standard cybersecurity frameworks and tools.

### Project Overview

#### The objective of this task was to understand and implement core SOC operations such as:

Alert prioritization and severity assessment

Incident classification and response lifecycle

Security alert triage and validation

Digital evidence preservation procedures

Full attack detection and response simulation

#### The project follows structured cybersecurity methodologies based on:

MITRE ATT&CK – Attack technique mapping

National Institute of Standards and Technology SP 800-61 – Incident handling guidelines

Wazuh – Security monitoring and alert detection

FIRST CVSS Framework – Vulnerability risk scoring

SANS Institute Incident response methodology

All activities were performed in a controlled simulated SOC environment for training purposes.
